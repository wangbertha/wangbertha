## Hi there! 👋

A little about me...

- ⚙ I began my career in mechanical engineering and management, working in industry for 5 years
- 🌱 I recently took a gap year and explored software engineering and web development. Its capabilities inspired me, and it reignited the part of me that loves and missed solving logic problems, stemming as far back as high school math competitions
- 💡 I decided to pivot and pursue my passion for coding, building independent projects and studying online resources, including algorithms & data structures and web development tutorials
- 👩‍🎓 I sought formal instruction and recently graduated from Fullstack Academy's 12-week web development immersive program
- 🌎 Outside of class, I have had the opportunity to contribute to open-source and nonprofit projects
- 💻 I'm looking for opportunities to build and maintain software solutions
- ❤ I am enamored by the power of coding and the beauty of logical, clean code!
