## Hi there! 👋

A little about me...

- ⚙ I have a background in mechanical engineering and management
- 💡 My love for logic problems and user experience forayed into my first interests in software engineering and web development
- 🌱 I started my software engineering journey through self-learning: building independent projects and studying online resources, including an introduction to computer science college course, algorithms & data structures, and [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
- 👩‍🎓 I’m a recent graduate of Fullstack Academy's web development immersive program
- 🌎 Outside of class, I have had the opportunity to contribute to open-source and nonprofit projects
- 💻 I'm looking for opportunities to build and maintain software solutions
- ❤ I am enamored by the power of coding and the beauty of logical, clean code!
