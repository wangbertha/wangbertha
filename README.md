## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

After starting my career with 5 years in mechanical engineering and management, I took a gap year and explored software engineering. Its capabilities across every industry inspired me, and it had a unique style of problem-solving that reminded me of puzzles I loved from a young age. I decided to officially pivot and pursue my passion for coding through self-study and independent projects. Recently, I sought formal instruction and graduated from Fullstack Academy's 12-week web development immersive program. In the past year, I have had the opportunity to contribute to open-source and nonprofit projects.
